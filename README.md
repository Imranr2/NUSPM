# NUSPM

<h3><strong>Proposed Level of Achievement:</strong> Gemini</h3>
<br>
<h2><strong>Project Scope</strong></h2>
<p>A webapp that allows students to connect and find better tutorial slots.

NUSPM enables students to create swap requests to trade their tutorial slot for a more desirable one. Students are also able to initiate swap requests with other students. This solves the current issue which involves asking on multiple platforms(Telegram, Reddit etcâ€¦) which is troublesome and inefficient.

<h2><strong>Motivation</strong></h2>
<p>Imagine that you were allocated a tutorial slot that does not fit in your timetable. At this point, you are feeling stressed out as you might not be able to secure your desired tutorial slot and might be forced to drop the module. You also have no way of knowing if there is another student willing to swap with your slot. Also due to the covid situation, it is difficult to reach out to other students taking the same module and you might be left with an undesirable slot even after the first add/swap tutorial exercise. What if there was a website that you can use to find potential swaps before the round starts? This will immensely alleviate the stress that you are having. Welcome to NUSPM, a website where you can create requests for swaps and also view requests created by other students who are facing the same problem.</p>
<h2><strong>Aim</strong></h2>
<p>We hope to create a more seamless tutorial swapping exercise as well as create a less stressful experience for all students through NUSPM.</p>
<h2><strong>User Stories</strong></h2>
<ol>
  <li>As a student who wants to swap their tutorial slot for another, I want to be able to view all possible options.
</li>
  <li>As a student, I would also want to create swap requests to improve my chances of finding a desired tutorial slot.</li>
  <li>As a student, I want to be able to update or delete my swap preference.</li>
  <li>As a student, I want to be able to view the details of the slot that is available and see the impact of the swap on my timetable.
</li>
</ol>
